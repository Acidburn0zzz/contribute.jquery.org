title: Contributing to the jQuery Community
---

In a sense, each of the different ways of getting involved that we detail on
this site are all ways of contributing to the jQuery community, which we define
quite liberally: **helping to make any aspect of using jQuery Foundation
projects better for other people.** This, of course, includes things like
filing and fixing bugs, but the discussion on this page focuses on just some of
the ways you can help have an impact on the **people**  part of that
definition!

## [Support](/support/)

Working on Q&amp;A is [awesome for a number of reasons](/support/), one of which
is the simple act of helping others, and sharing in the camaraderie that
comes with being a developer. Over time, the nicknames and handles of strangers
may come to be familiar mentors, mentees, and friends.

## Attend Conferences and Meetups

Whether at our own [jQuery Conferences](http://events.jquery.org), other
JavaScript and web events, or local meetups, getting out from behind your
monitor and into the same room with other developers can be a great way to
expand your horizons and refine your skills. At the same time, they're also an
opportunity to have conversations that breed inspiration, and forge
relationships that foster collaboration.

## *Speak At* Conferences and Meetups

It's hard for all that other magic to happen at events if there's no one to
present any material. Demonstrating new techniques and technologies, expounding
on ideas big or small, or simply telling a good story are all ways you can
share your experience with the community.  Even if you think you have "nothing
to talk about," or you haven't given a talk before, coming up with an idea may
be easier than you think. If you don't think you're ready to speak at a
big conference, try a local meetup or user group first!

## Write and Share Plugins

If writing code and giving it away for free is still more your speed, then
publishing your jQuery plugins for use by others is an excellent way to make a
big impact. jQuery's plugin system is a major part of why it's become so
popular, and plugins are the ideal way to add new functionality to jQuery.
(Even if you think something belongs in jQuery Core, we recommend building it
in a plugin first, to test the implementation and show the demand for the
feature.) So if you've built something useful, don't keep it to yourself! With
the new [jQuery Plugin Registry](http://plugins.jquery.com), it's easier than
ever before to publish your plugin and get it in front of users.
